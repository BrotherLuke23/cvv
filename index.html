  <h3>Employment/Work Experience</h3>
  <p><em><strong>Big T Electrical - Wallasey Electrical Apprentice - 2019 - 2021 :</strong></em></p>
  <p>Working with a qualified electrician working on residential properties I learnt general electrical skills including wiring, fitting and removing items, ordering goods and keeping the area clean and safe at all times. I had to work to a deadline, in a precise manner and deal with customers to a high standard. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Champs SA - Karate School - Durban South Africa - Assistant Karate Instructor - 2010 - 2015 :</strong></em></p>
  <p>Training initially and then working as an instructor in a Karate School in S.Africa – I trained and supervised children and classes aged 4- 13 yrs. I planned fitness routines, exercises, reliance training and martial arts techniques. I found this very rewarding and it helped me develop my mentoring as a teacher. </p>

  <h3>Interests/Hobbies</h3>
  <p>In my spare time I like to keep fit and maintain my martial arts training, I have a black belt in karate, this is a sport I have a passion for due to the fitness level required as well as the mental strength needed to succeed in this field. My inspiration is this area is focused on people like Bruce Lee who lead a good example of the discipline needed in this sport. I am drawn to Japanese and Chinese culture, I enjoy travelling and these are countries I would like to visit in the future.
